## Problems
### Problems that need corrections on Frontend
1. I needed to use ng-deep for the ui inner styling, i want to make a better solution than that.
2. I need to make the ui more responsive.
3. I still have the NG0912 error that pops up randomly in the consol (dupliacted component ID). It might cause a problme somewhere or be a hint to solve my other problems.
4. the primeNG variables (--p-text-color, --p-border-color, etc.) load after the associated prime component, thus I need to refresh to get the styling of prime components.
